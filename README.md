# Job Listing Project

This is a CRUD Job Listing project made using React.
 
* This project currently uses JSON Server as a mock backend, but the goal is to integrate an actual backend to enhance its functionality. 
* There are plans to expand the project to support various use cases, making it more versatile and robust.

* This project is deployed using GitHub Pages for demonstration purposes. However, certain features may not function as intended because it relies on a mock backend to simulate API requests.
For full functionality, it should be integrated with a live backend service.
